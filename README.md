# Flappy Bird
Creating a 2D Game

Notice this is written for Expo v22.

Because this game uses Three.js you will only be able to run it on a physical device! No Simulators üòê

## Prerequisites
- NodeJS 6+ (LTS)
- Expo XDE/CLI + iOS/Android App

## Built With:
* [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/)
* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
* [Three](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)

Using Expo, React Native, and Three makes it really easy (and extremely fun) to write production ready mobile games!
